# Navigation Power-ups - VS Code Extension

## Overview

**Navigation Power-ups** is a Visual Studio Code extension that enhances your workflow by providing intuitive navigation tools for files that VS Code does not natively support. Currently, the extension generates a powerful navigation tree for `.http` files, making it easier to manage and explore API requests.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Navigation**: Automatically builds a navigation tree for `.http` files, allowing for quick and easy access to different requests within the file.
- **Real-time Navigation Updates**: The navigation tree dynamically updates as you edit, save, or switch between `.http` files.

Stay tuned for more features and expanded support in future versions!
